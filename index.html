    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The water bottle/canister is not inside of the black box.We could consistently see why the model was pouring out more or less and the black box was very random in terms of how much came out.</p>
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p> The mystery black box is a box that when water is poured in, different amounts come out and we have to figure out why this is the case. To try and figure it out we made a model of what we thought was inside that included a funnel, and a tube that split into two tubes, with one path being a water bottle and the other path being the exit. We tested the model by pouring water in and seeing if the data we collected was similar to what the class got. For like 3 to 5 trials not as much water came out as we poured it in. But after that it seemed that more water came out everytime.
</p>
    <h2>Reasoning I</h2>
    <p>Models are a way for us to test and predict what can happen. In this experiment a model will help us understand what could work and what won’t work, models are also your prediction which doesn’t mean it’s always gonna be correct. In general models are a basic understanding of the more complex final product.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning II</h2>
    <p>The reason there is no water bottle canister in the black box is because of the tests that we conducted for our model. It's very simple to see that once the bottle gets full, the water that comes out will always be the same or more than what was poured in, because there's nowhere else to go.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning III</h2>
    <p>If there was a water bottle/canister inside of the black box we would be able to see a clear pattern after that canister filled up and the data of the amount of liquid that came out of the tube would almost always be the same as the amount poured in.</p>
